# Tracking System

## Project Overview

The Tracking System is a web application built with Django that provides functionality for tracking various entities. It is designed to handle administrative tasks efficiently using Django's command-line utility. The application utilizes PostgreSQL for database management and Redis for caching, ensuring robust performance and scalability.

## Installation

To set up the Tracking System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd tracking_system
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:
   Ensure you have `Django` and any other dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Docker Compose**:
   Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Start the application using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You can manage the application functionalities through the Django admin interface or through the built-in API (if applicable).

To run administrative tasks, you can use:
```bash
python manage.py <command>
```
Replace `<command>` with the desired Django command, such as `runserver`, `migrate`, or `createsuperuser`.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
- **Administration**: Full access to the Django admin panel for managing entities.
- **Caching**: Uses Redis to cache data and improve performance.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for reliable and robust data storage.
